# Fifteen percent
## About
I called a fifteen percent keyboard, because it has only 32 keys in total, which is around thirty percent of a regular keyboard. Since it is a split keyboard, each *board* has around fifteen keys.
## CAD
There is nothing really special about this, there is only a lid, and base for each.

## Schematic
Once again there is nothing really special. There are just the keys connected to a pico, according to rows, and columns. The picos are connected through a TRRS cable, and the right one, has a 0.96 inch OLED.

## PCB
This is just a simple PCB, I designed in Kicad.
