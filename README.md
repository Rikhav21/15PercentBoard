# Fifteen percent
## About
I called a fifteen percent keyboard, because it has only 32 keys in total, which is around thirty percent of a regular keyboard. Since it is a split keyboard, each *board* has around fifteen keys. I also made it as a grid, because those are supposedly better according to this one friend that I have but it is going to take like 3-4 weeks to adjust so have fun with relearning how to type!
## CAD
There is nothing really special about this, there is only a lid, and base for each. I am thinking of printing these in green, and in my opinion the renderings look pretty cool. They should be able to fit on my A1 mini, which is part of the reason why I made a split board in the first place.

## Schematic
Once again there is nothing really special. There are just the keys connected to a pico, according to rows, and columns. The picos are connected through a TRRS cable, and the right one, has a 0.96 inch OLED. I am going to have to see where I can get the TRRS cable connectors for cheaper, as right now thhe plugs seem way to overprices at 8 dollars per.

## PCB
This is just a simple PCB, I designed in Kicad.  I have all of the files in the github repo, and I am not really good at PCB design, it was my second time, which is partially why the routes are not really clean. However I do feel proud of it because it is pretty complex and I had to redo it like 3 times, and I only have 15 percent of the necassery keys.

## Firmware
I spent way to long making the firmware, because I was trying to map out the entire keyboard in my head, however this is only a standin for some better firmware later. After I actually build the board I am thinking of adding a bit more functionality, where pressing the 6 side keys could all have some cool function, and hte OLED would display what mode it was in, but for now th efirmwayre is still pretty basic until I actually make the thing.
## Matierials.
For this I will need some
- screws (m3) around 15mm
- heatset inserts m3x4x5
- Cerry MX, PCB mount keys (I want the really annoying clicky blue ones.)
- keycaps (I might just 3d print these)
- 2 raspberry picos
- 0.96 inch OLED
- Pin headers (I think that  is what those are called)
- TRRS cable
- TRRS connectors.
